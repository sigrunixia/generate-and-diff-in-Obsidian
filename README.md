# Diff and compare

Diff and Compare is an Obsidian plugin designed for a specific purpose: to generate notes of your file tree across multiple devices and compare them to identify differences.

I developed this plugin to assist Obsidian users who rely on syncing services in pinpointing files that failed to transfer successfully between devices.

Please note that this plugin is designed for troubleshooting purposes only and does not resolve syncing issues.
